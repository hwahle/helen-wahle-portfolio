  <h1>introduction</h1>
  <p>Creative and opinionated crime-fiction junkie. Social media specialist by day and avid doodler by night.</p>
  <p>I am most passionate about social justice and equality. That everyone has equal access to social, political, and economic opportunities is chiefly important. <br /> <br />I try to see each day as a chance to be more informed than I was yesterday in order to be a better advocate & ally for the many, many marginalized groups of people in this world</p>

<section class="location-section">
  <h1>where i'm from</h1>
  <p>I proudly hail from Naptown; aka, Indianapolis. But upon graduating from Indiana University in 2013, I relocated West to Los Angeles and I've been here ever since.</p>

  <h1>more about me...</h1>
  <h2>what are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>Besides Netflix, my hobbies include drawing, reading, listening to podcasts, and making my friends laugh.</p>
  <h2>what's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>That's a dead-even tie between a Food Critic and a Travel Writer.</p>
  <h2>what are you listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>I'm all about FKA Twigs and Majid Jordan at the moment. I've probably listened to Kanye West every day since 2007 though.</p>
